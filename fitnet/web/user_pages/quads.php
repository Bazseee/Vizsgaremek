                            thigh. Leg extension exercises typically involve the use of a leg extension machine found in
                            most gyms.

                            lower body exercise that targets multiple muscle groups simultaneously, including the
                            quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, and calves. It involves placing a barbell across the
                            shoulders while standing in a split stance, with one foot positioned forward and the other
                            foot positioned back on an elevated surface. As you lower your body into a squat position,
                            the forward knee bends while the back knee descends towards the ground. This exercise
                            improves lower body strength, stability, and balance, making it a valuable addition to any
                            strength training routine.

                            a highly effective unilateral leg exercise. In this exercise, you stand in a split stance
                            with one foot elevated behind you on a bench or platform while holding a dumbbell in each
                            hand. As you lower your body into a squat position, the forward knee bends while the back
                            knee descends towards the ground. This exercise targets the quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes,
                            and stabilizing muscles of the lower body, improving strength, balance, and stability.

                            exercise. Positioned against the padded support, you place your shoulders and back, with
                            feet on the platform. Pushing against the platform, you extend your legs to lift the
                            weighted sled along the machine's track, targeting the quadriceps, hamstrings, and glutes.
                            It offers a safer alternative to free-weight squats, focusing on lower body strength and
